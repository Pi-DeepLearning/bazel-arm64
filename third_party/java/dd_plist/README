Description:

dd-plist
This library enables Java applications to work with property lists in various
formats.

You can parse existing property lists (e.g. those created by an iOS application)
and work with the contents on any operating system.

The library also enables you to create your own property lists from scratch and
store them in various formats.

The provided API mimics the Cocoa/NeXTSTEP API, granting access to the basic
functions of classes like NSDictionary, NSData, etc.

dd-plist has full support for the Android operating system. Consequently this
library can be of great help when it comes to porting iOS apps to Android.

Local Modifications:
- LICENSE file has been created for compliance purposes. Not included in
  original distribution.
- Rewrote some functions in ASCIIPropertyListParser.java to support characters
  outside of the 7-bit ASCII range.
- Support surrogate pairs from \u escaped chars in strings in
  ASCIIPropertyListParser.java.
- Allow \ escaping of characters that need not be escaped in
  ASCIIPropertyListParser.java.
- Make PropertyListParser.determineType handle an empty bytes array properly.
- https://github.com/3breadt/dd-plist/commit/3fa1fa56c82df169e06079feb54ba281ad41cae6
which stabilizes ordering and is required for plists to be parsed by some Apple
plist parsers.
- https://github.com/3breadt/dd-plist/commit/a5fb37384d4ca7a3b5039a7605ca0e9ca926a6ec
which causes dictionaries to generate ids for values the same way the Apple
implementation does it.
