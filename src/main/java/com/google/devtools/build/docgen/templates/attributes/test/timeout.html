<p>
How long the test is normally expected to run before returning.

<p>
While a test's size attribute controls resource estimation, a test's
timeout may be set independently.  If not explicitly specified, the
timeout is based on the test's size (with "small" &rArr; "short",
"medium" &rArr; "moderate", etc...). By default, "short" means 1 minute,
"moderate" 5 minutes, and "long" 15 minutes (this can be overridden with
--test_timeout, e.g. for running under certain configurations which are
known to be slow).
