<p><code>String "enormous", "large" "medium" or "small",
default is "medium"; optional</code></p>

<p>How "heavy" the test is.</p>

<p>A classification of the test's "heaviness": how much time/resources
it needs to run.</p>

<p>Unittests are considered "small", integration tests "medium", and end-to-end tests "large" or
"enormous". Bazel uses the size to determine a default timeout (which can be overridden using the
"timeout" attribute) and the amount of resources that have to be acquired for the test to run.
The mapping of test size to resource is currently:</p>
