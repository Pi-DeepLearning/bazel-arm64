/**
 * Interface for a configuration transition using dynamic configurations.
 *
 * <p>The concept is simple: given the input configuration's build options, the
 * transition does whatever it wants to them and returns the modified result.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be stateless: the transformation logic cannot use
 * any information from any data besides the input build options.
 *
 * <p>For performance reasons, the input options are passed in as a <i>reference</i>,
 * not a <i>copy</i>. Transition implementations should <i>always</i> treat these
 * options as immutable, and call
 * {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.BuildOptions#clone}
 * before applying any mutations. Unfortunately,
 * {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.BuildOptions} does not currently
 * enforce immutability, so care must be taken not to modify the wrong instance.
