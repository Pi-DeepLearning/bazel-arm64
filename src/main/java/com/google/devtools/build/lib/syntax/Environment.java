/**
 * An Environment is the main entry point to evaluating code in the BUILD language or Skylark. It
 * embodies all the state that is required to evaluate such code, except for the current instruction
 * pointer, which is an {@link ASTNode} whose {@link Statement#exec exec} or {@link Expression#eval
 * eval} method is invoked with this Environment, in a straightforward direct-style AST-walking
 * interpreter. {@link Continuation}-s are explicitly represented, but only partly, with another
 * part being implicit in a series of try-catch statements, to maintain the direct style. One
 * notable trick is how a {@link UserDefinedFunction} implements returning values as the function
 * catching a {@link ReturnStatement.ReturnException} thrown by a {@link ReturnStatement} in the
 * body.
 *
 * <p>Every Environment has a {@link Mutability} field, and must be used within a function that
 * creates and closes this {@link Mutability} with the try-with-resource pattern. This {@link
 * Mutability} is also used when initializing mutable objects within that Environment; when closed
 * at the end of the computation freezes the Environment and all those objects that then become
 * forever immutable. The pattern enforces the discipline that there should be no dangling mutable
 * Environment, or concurrency between interacting Environment-s. It is also an error to try to
 * mutate an Environment and its objects from another Environment, before the {@link Mutability} is
 * closed.
 *
 * <p>One creates an Environment using the {@link #builder} function, then populates it with {@link
 * #setup}, {@link #setupDynamic} and sometimes {@link #setupOverride}, before to evaluate code in
 * it with {@link BuildFileAST#eval}, or with {@link BuildFileAST#exec} (where the AST was obtained
 * by passing a {@link ValidationEnvironment} constructed from the Environment to {@link
 * BuildFileAST#parseBuildFile} or {@link BuildFileAST#parseSkylarkFile}). When the computation is
 * over, the frozen Environment can still be queried with {@link #lookup}.
 *
 * <p>Final fields of an Environment represent its dynamic state, i.e. state that remains the same
 * throughout a given evaluation context, and don't change with source code location, while mutable
 * fields embody its static state, that change with source code location. The seeming paradox is
 * that the words "dynamic" and "static" refer to the point of view of the source code, and here we
 * have a dual point of view.

   * A Frame is a Map of bindings, plus a {@link Mutability} and a parent Frame

   * <p>A Frame contains bindings mapping variable name to variable value in a given scope.
   * It may also inherit bindings from a parent Frame corresponding to a parent scope,
   * which in turn may inherit bindings from its own parent, etc., transitively.
   * Bindings may shadow bindings from the parent. In Skylark, you may only mutate
   * bindings from the current Frame, which always got its {@link Mutability} with the
   * current {@link Environment}; but future extensions may make it more like Python
   * and allow mutation of bindings in outer Frame-s (or then again may not).
   *
   * <p>A Frame inherits the {@link Mutability} from the {@link Environment} in which it was
   * originally created. When that {@link Environment} is finalized and its {@link Mutability}
   * is closed, it becomes immutable, including the Frame, which can be shared in other
   * {@link Environment}-s. Indeed, a {@link UserDefinedFunction} will close over the global
   * Frame of its definition {@link Environment}, which will thus be reused (immutably)
   * in any {@link Environment} in which this function is called, so it's important to
   * preserve the {@link Mutability} to make sure no Frame is modified after it's been finalized.
