Usage: blaze %{command} <options> <test-targets>

Builds and runs the specified test targets using the specified options while
collecting code coverage statistics. Optionally, it also generates combined
HTML report containing coverage results for all executed tests.

This command accepts all valid options to 'test' and 'build', and inherits
defaults for 'test' (and 'build') from your .blazerc.  If you don't use
.blazerc, don't forget to pass all your 'build' options to '%{command}' too.

See 'blaze help target-syntax' for details and examples on how to
specify targets.
