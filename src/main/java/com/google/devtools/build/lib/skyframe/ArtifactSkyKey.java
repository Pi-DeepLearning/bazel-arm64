/**
 * A utility class for {@link SkyKey}s coming from {@link Artifact}s. Source artifacts are checked
 * for existence, while output artifacts imply creation of the output file.
 *
 * <p>There are effectively three kinds of output artifact values corresponding to these keys. The
 * first corresponds to an ordinary artifact {@link FileArtifactValue}. It stores the relevant data
 * for the artifact -- digest/mtime and size. The second corresponds to either an "aggregating"
 * artifact -- the output of an aggregating middleman action -- or a TreeArtifact. It stores the
 * relevant data of all its inputs, as well as a combined digest for itself.

   * Artifacts are compared using just their paths, but in Skyframe, the configured target that owns
   * an artifact must also be part of the comparison. For example, suppose we build //foo:foo in
   * configurationA, yielding artifact foo.out. If we change the configuration to configurationB in
   * such a way that the path to the artifact does not change, requesting foo.out from the graph
   * will result in the value entry for foo.out under configurationA being returned. This would
   * prevent caching the graph in different configurations, and also causes big problems with change
   * pruning, which assumes the invariant that a value's first dependency will always be the same.
   * In this case, the value entry's old dependency on //foo:foo in configurationA would cause it to
   * request (//foo:foo, configurationA) from the graph, causing an undesired re-analysis of
   * (//foo:foo, configurationA).
   *
   * <p>In order to prevent that, instead of using Artifacts as keys in the graph, we use
   * OwnedArtifacts, which compare for equality using both the Artifact, and the owner. The effect
   * is functionally that of making Artifact.equals() check the owner, but only within Skyframe,
   * since outside of Skyframe it is quite crucial that Artifacts with different owners be able to
   * compare equal.
