/**
 * An object describing that actions require a particular implementation of an
 * {@link ActionContext}.
 *
 * <p>This is expected to be implemented by modules that also implement actions which need these
 * contexts. Other modules will provide implementations for various action contexts by implementing
 * {@link ActionContextProvider}.
 *
 * <p>Example: a module requires {@code SpawnActionContext} to do its job, and it creates
 * actions with the mnemonic <code>C++</code>. Then the {@link #getSpawnActionContexts} method of
 * this module would return a map with the key <code>"C++"</code> in it.
 *
 * <p>The module can either decide for itself which implementation is needed and make the value
 * associated with this key a constant or defer that decision to the user, for example, by
 * providing a command line option and setting the value in the map based on that.
 *
 * <p>Other modules are free to provide different implementations of {@code SpawnActionContext}.
 * This can be used, for example, to implement sandboxed or distributed execution of
 * {@code SpawnAction}s in different ways, while giving the user control over how exactly they
 * are executed.

   * <p>If a spawn action is executed whose mnemonic maps to the empty string or is not
   * present in the map at all, the choice of the implementation is left to Blaze.
   *
   * <p>Matching on mnemonics is done case-insensitively so it is recommended that any
   * implementation of this method makes sure that no two keys that refer to the same mnemonic are
   * present in the returned map. The easiest way to assure this is to use a map created using
